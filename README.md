# Student Performance: Analys och Prognos

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using tree-based machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and Decision Tree, to understand which factors most significantly impact final grades. The main goals are to clean and explore the data, build predictive models, and optimize these models to achieve the highest possible accuracy while understanding the relevance of each feature.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data for better analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into relationships between student behaviors, parental factors, and academic success.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Use Random Forest and Decision Tree models to predict student grades and evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune model parameters to improve prediction accuracy and ensure robust model performance.

## Key Components
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensure data quality by identifying and addressing any missing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transform the raw data, encode categorical values, and normalize where needed to create features that enhance model effectiveness.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Summary Statistics**: Use functions like `describe()` to understand the data and identify key distributions.
- **Visualizations**: Utilize various charts and graphs to highlight relationships between features, such as student habits and academic performance.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Random Forest and Decision Tree**: Train tree-based models to predict student outcomes using `scikit-learn`.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform GridSearch with cross-validation to identify the best hyperparameters for the model.
